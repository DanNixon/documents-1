## Requirements document for generalized superplot-like functionality

### Context

Superplot (LAMP) is a tool for comparison of 1D data which offers convenient overplotting of multiple 1D curves that can be from the same or different workspaces. Without loss of generality, they can also be 1D slices or projections of arbitrary MD data. The key elements are the sliders over spectra and over different workspaces and hold buttons to keep the current spectrum on the plot.

The tools mantid offers currently are mostly suited for inspection of single workspaces. This makes comparison of several workspaces not so ergonomic. For example for a visual comparison of instrument views of two workspaces one has to open two individual instances of the instrument viewer over the two workspaces. There is a DataComparison GUI which however offers very limited functionality.
