    * ORNL - Granroth, Peterson, Proffen, Leal
    * ISIS - Draper, Greenfield, Pascal, Griffin, Cottrell

## Topics

1. Changes to the PMB
    - ISIS: Griffin will substitute Greenfield in her absence.

3. Actions
    - Powder diffraction training material (Granroth)
        - The training material was swapped with direct geoometry spectometer and will be availble in the form of notebooks in August.
    - New IDF:
        The major need appears to be at the ILL for indirect geometry. To be completed.
    - Mantid core team and long term plan (Taylor)
        - Small teams will be formed at all the institutes to form a Core Team.
        - The Core team will write a report that will be delivered to the PMB by September.
        - The report shoud include what needs to be done (i.e. a specification for Mantid), resources and time scales.
        - Some discussion involved:
            - Core team should look into: Pyton core + `C++` when needed vs `C++` core with Python bindings
            - Involve scientists that have used the Python API and have gone through some fustrations using it.
            - Scientist should review the first draft design
            - The new framework should be much easier to develop into.
            - Contributing to the framework should be easy.
        - The guiding principle decided was:
            - Not a totally loose guideline for the core team.
            - The team should focus on the Scipy style library and workspaces from the Mantid 5 year plan
            - Focus on the performance and stability

7. Facility updates / news 
    - SNS: Powergen is comming soon and will need a new IDF.
    - ILL: has finished the developments for Back Scattering

10. Scientific steering committee discussion
    - The feedback from the users workshop:
        - Users provide a different perspective
        - Need to decide what Mantid does: Reduction and Analysis vs just reduction?
