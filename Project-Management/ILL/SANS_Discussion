Default Q binning
-----------------

- Q binning can be specified by the user, but what is the preferred default? And for TOF?

Parallax correction (gondola effect) and detector efficiencies
--------------------------------------------------------------

- How to properly decouple the flight-path (2theta) dependence from actual efficiency through attenuation?

- [TOF] What about wavelength dependence of attenuation?

Beam stop masking
-----------------

- This can be done manually, but one can automatize by either finding the shadow on the detector, or using the shape and the position of the beam stop.

Resolution
----------

- Mildner-Carpenter? What about TOF resolution?

[TOF] Wavelength axis
---------------------

- Wavelength axes are adjusted for each pixel individually based on L2 distance.

Dead time correction
--------------------

- How to model flux and wavelength dependence?

Stitching
---------

- Which kind of stitching is desired? Is stitched data used only for visualisation, or actually in the analysis?

Beam center (gravity)
---------------------

- Currently center of mass of the direct beam is calculated, then the detector is moved in vertical axis such that the beam center is at z=0.

- Is this a good approximation?

- [TOF] Beam center can be calculated for each wavelength bin. Cannot move the detector, but can move the counts correspondingly

- Is this a good approximation? Would analytical correction for gravity (essentially z+=gtË†2/2) be applicable?
