* Copyright Update - Nick
* `mantidworkbench` demo of [sample logs](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/23709), [abstracting qt4/qt5](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/23811) before [adding custom guis](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/23778), and instrument view
  * RHEL, ubuntu, windows, and osx packages are “done”
  * instrument view is in
  * most python based guis have been converted over
  * algorithm list searches in middle of name
  * sample log viewer can overplot values
  
Coming next:
* help system
