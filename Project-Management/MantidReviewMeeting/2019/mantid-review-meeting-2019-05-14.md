Agenda
======

* Jenkins now uses new mechanism capturing test failures. (Martyn)
  * It should catch all test failures, segfaults etc and avoid having to dig through the log
* Jenkins also has a [new warnings parser](https://builds.mantidproject.org/job/master_flake8/2802/flake8/) (Martyn)
  * The old one got deprecated and this one seems to produce nice output too.
