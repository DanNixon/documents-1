The following is a collated list of feedback from various people during the Workbench demos session.

They have been transferred to issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/projects/9).

- Save/Reset layout to my default
  - Can we share "defaults" easily?
- Superplot: check with SNS r.e. slice viewer
- Labels for 1D plots, are they all correct?
- Separate out python/mantid output in Messages
  - Also filter python output from separate tabs
- Workspaces associated with plots???
  - Query with James/Reflectometers
Sample logs viewer:
  - Exporting logs to table workspace (for plotting too)
  - Drag and drop logs to existing plots
  - Hide plot when not a time series
  - Plot doesn't work if value is not double
  - Check it plots "time < 0"
  - Select multiple workspaces and overplot same log from multiple workspaces
